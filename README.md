# DeepLearningProject
Final Group Project for Deep Learning Course

Group Members: Daniel Downs, Tiffany Dinh, Shyam Goyal, Stavan Stah, Phillip Zhu

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria

## Assignment
Our assignment was to find a dataset that had business implications and build a neural network using the dataset. 
We chose to build an image classifier as neural networks are incredibly useful for image classification. 
The dataset we used included cell images that are infected with malaria as well as ones not infected with malaria. 
Utilizing neural networks to detect illnesses and infections can speed up the detection process and save lives
while also being financially advantageous to pharmaceutical companies.
